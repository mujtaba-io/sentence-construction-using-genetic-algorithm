# Sentence Construction Using Genetic Algorithm

This is another small program from my summer vacation junejuly 2024 set of practice programs. I studied genetic-aalgorithm in AI course in 5th sem, so I decided to make use of it.

The program aims to construct a valid sentence from a list of random words. It utilizes a text file as a corpus to compare the fitness of the sentence with the corpus. To find the best sentence, it uses genetic algorithm. However, as the corpus size increases, the program becomes very slower due to expensive string comparisons with large corpus file.
